Puzzle Game using Java AWT

This project is a GUI-based 8-Puzzle Game developed using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit).
The game contains a 3×3 grid of numbered tiles where one tile is empty. The user rearranges the tiles by clicking them to solve the puzzle. When the tiles are arranged in correct order, the game displays a “Congratulations! You won.” message.

This project demonstrates the concepts of:
Event Handling
GUI Programming
Logical Conditions
Button Components
Basic Game Logic in Java

Objectives of the Project

To implement a basic puzzle game using Java AWT.
To understand button events & action listeners.
To learn GUI layouting using absolute positions.
To perform logical checks to detect the win condition.

Technologies Used
Technology	Description
Java	Core programming language
AWT	GUI components (Buttons, Frame)
Swing	Used only for JOptionPane dialog
OOPS Concepts	Classes, Objects, Methods

How the Game Works

The UI has 9 buttons arranged like a puzzle board.
One tile is empty to allow tile movement.
Clicking adjacent numbered buttons swaps them with the empty tile.
The game is completed when tiles appear in this sequence:

1 2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 (empty)
